# Grindery Zapier EVM ABI

The project uses [Custom Smart Contract (EVM) Connector](https://github.com/grindery-io/grindery-nexus-schema-v2/blob/staging/cds/web3/evmGenericAbi.json) to call EVM smart-contract functions and listen for events.

This Zapier integration project is generated by the `zapier init` CLI command.

These are what you normally do next:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install  # or you can use yarn

# Run tests
zapier test

# Register the integration on Zapier if you haven't
zapier register "App Title"

# Or you can link to an existing integration on Zapier
zapier link

# Push it to Zapier
zapier push
```
